My name is Chris Isaacs and I have been helping businesses build great products and services for over twenty years. Most recently I was working with Moodyâ€™s Corporation developing infrastructure tooling for a flagship GPT platform and a portfolio of applications. 

I'm a proficient technical director and highly experienced hands-on engineer with expertise in DevOps, product and platform delivery. A conscientious leader skilled in performance & quality management, talent development & retention and partnering with business, technical, creatives and stakeholders. 

I have experience of several different industries including gaming, genealogy, publishing, gambling, financial intelligence and psychology. I have shipped software for a bunch of different platforms, from games consoles and mobile to server and web applications. As well as working hard for large organisations, I have also worked with a bunch of SMEs and helped found and bootstrap a startup.  

I know how to build, ship and operate software products and services, infrastructure, automated tools and integrations while supporting the development of business processes and operations to create real value.
