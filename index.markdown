Hi! My name is Chris Isaacs, and this is my personal site and blog. It contains some information about me, how I put the site together, reasons for the choices made, and the tools used in the process. My purpose is to practice my blogging skills and to hopefully share knowledge and ideas with the community. If you would like to share feedback, then please get in touch via my socials.
